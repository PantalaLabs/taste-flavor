Pantala Labs - Taste & Flavor

Taste & Flavor is an Open-Source Eurorack module project of a step/gate sequencer coupled to a 6 track sample player and a stem mixer that aims to fill a major gap in live performances with modular synthesizers allowing you to mix from/to moods.<br>

This mood transition is part of a concept I created called Mood Oriented Instruments. These instruments, in our case the module, must have the ability not only to reproduce sounds on demand, presets, but also, through algorithms, to add some level of intelligence to the final sound composition.<br>

The module has an easy to understand interface with few buttons / controls ensuring its easy use, creative and especially with extremely fluid dynamics for sound transitions inspired by the possibilities available in a DJ Set. Why the DJ Set? Because the DJ Set allows infinite flexibility when choosing the next track.<br>

The module operates with 6 sample tracks triggered by a predefined pattern.<br>

Allows to mix samples and patterns from any individual track / MOOD.<br>

Allows you to edit each pattern using the Tap/Erase/Ghost functions on master track.<br>

Allows you to Undo the Tap sequence if you miss some step.<br>

And finally, the morph/crossfader feature to make transitions form one Mood to another. This is the biggest feature that guarantees the idea of "fluid dynamics."<br>

The project is already done. Just waiting the finel panels.<br>
<br>

Why am I contacting you?<br>
I´m asking for a few Collaborative Music Producers to share your MOOD samples along with this incredible open-source project.<br>
If you received this document, somehow I like your sound and, above that, I think your sounds will be extremely useful in the hands of countless users of modular synthesizers.<br>
Your collaboration is done sharing one (or more) sample kits. Sounds that defines the essence of your musical style.<br>

This Sample Kit associated with a Grid Pattern and a Fantasy Name mold a MOOD:

-6 samples: Usually  a kick, bass, clap, hats, snares, pads / ambients. All samples should be rendered with: 16bit / 44100kh and must have the final volume already processed.
-a grid pattern or a MIDI file: a 64 step grid organized in 4ppqn / 4 steps per Beat. It could even be a picture of Ableton or another DAW with the firing sequence of the samples.
-a fantasy name: A fancy name for your mood: Pantala - Walking on the Moon.
It is very important to make clear that this project is all Open-Source, so ther is no money involved.<br>
No money will be paid for the samples.<br>
Anyone can copy / share / modify its contents.<br>
The couterpart is that your samples will make this a better project and will be available to all modular synth users.

If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them.

Thank you so much for the patient reading! I am available for any chat.
