Taste & Flavor is an Eurorack module consisting of a step sequencer coupled to a multiple sample player and a track mixer that aims to fill a major gap in live performances with modular synthesizers allowing you to create a new mood with every percussion change. 
This mood transition is part of a concept I created called Mood Oriented Instruments. These instruments, in our case the module, must have the ability not only to reproduce sounds on demand, presets, but also, through algorithms, to add some level of intelligence to the final sound composition.
The module has an easy to understand interface with few buttons / controls ensuring its easy use, creative and especially with extremely fluid dynamics for sound transitions inspired by the possibilities available in a DJ Set. Why the DJ Set? Because the DJ Set allows infinite flexibility in choosing the next song.

•Module:
It basically operates with 6 sample tracks triggered by a predefined pattern. (see Annex II)
Allows samples and patterns from each individual track to be exchanged for samples and patterns from other MOODs.
Allows you to edit each pattern using the Tap on each track.
Allows you to Undo the Tap sequence if you miss some step.
And finally, Morph's manual command that transitions track by track from one Mood to another. This is the biggest feature that guarantees the idea of "fluid dynamics."
