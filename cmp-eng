Pantala Labs - Taste & Flavor / CMP
• Macro
Taste & Flavor is an Eurorack module consisting of a step sequencer coupled to a multiple sample player and a track mixer that aims to fill a major gap in live performances with modular synthesizers allowing you to create a new mood with every percussion change. 
This mood transition is part of a concept I created called Mood Oriented Instruments. These instruments, in our case the module, must have the ability not only to reproduce sounds on demand, presets, but also, through algorithms, to add some level of intelligence to the final sound composition.
The module has an easy to understand interface with few buttons / controls ensuring its easy use, creative and especially with extremely fluid dynamics for sound transitions inspired by the possibilities available in a DJ Set. Why the DJ Set? Because the DJ Set allows infinite flexibility in choosing the next song.

•Module:
It basically operates with 6 sample tracks triggered by a predefined pattern. (see Annex I)
Allows samples and patterns from each individual track to be exchanged for samples and patterns from other MOODs.
Allows you to edit each pattern using the Tap on each track.
Allows you to Undo the Tap sequence if you miss some step.
And finally, Morph's manual command that transitions track by track from one Mood to another. This is the biggest feature that guarantees the idea of "fluid dynamics."
The project has 80% of the technology implemented and is already able to carry out all the tasks cited in the initial scope. Now entering the testing phase, improvements, new ideas and life cycle assessment.

• CMP
Why am I contacting you?
I initially need a few Collaborative Music Producers (CMP) so I can receive their materials, test al module life cycle like import issues, compatibility, and create a video based on these new MOODs.
If you received this project document, I somehow like your sound and, above that, I think it will be extremely useful in the hands of countless users of modular synthesizers.
CMP collaboration is to create one (or more) sample kits that characterize your sound. That defines a part of the essence of your musical style, your idea of music.
This Sample Kit associated with a Grid Pattern and a Fantasy Name mold a MOOD:
1. -6 samples: Can be any sound, kick, hats, snares, pads, ambients. All must be recorded with: 24bit / 44100kh and must have the final volume already processed. In the case of Kick and Bass, if played at the same time, they should be sent already mixed.
2. -a grid pattern: a 64 step grid organized in 4ppqn / 4 steps by Beat. It could even be a picture of Ableton or another DAW with the firing sequence of the samples. See Annex II
3. -a fantasy name: A fancy name for your mood: Gibran Solomao-Walking on the Moon.
The second point, is that, if you receive this briefing, I really like your music my exchange proposal does not involve money. PMC is a contributor.
If one day this module becomes salable, it is PMC's option to donate your MOOD so that I can continue with the project or simply request to remove them. Even if you opt to stay within the project, I have to say (again) I can't afford the samples.
If the CMP does not receive money for their samples, what other advantages will they have: 
•	You are helping the only Brazilian digital module developer to create a new idea and a new class of instruments. As far as I know, there is nothing like it for modular synthesizers.
•	All my projects are open-source They are available to view, use, change, create (CC-BY-SA) based on all the information of the project. Automatically you are helping to spread good information and knowledge.
•	You will have your name floating within the biosphere of modular synthesizers.
•	You will have credit for your participation.
•	You will have my gratitude for helping with this process.
Remember that there is a big risk of failure. Financial investment, time, knowledge, work, project development, prototyping and etc will only be mine? While the PMC will have none. 
If one day this module become salable, it is an option for PMC to donate your MOOD so I can continue with the project or simply ask for the withdrawal. If I stay within the project, I point out that (again) I can't afford to pay for samples.
If I remember other advantages, update this item. The last thing I want is a court battle and losing friends.
If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them. Any questions will serve as material for the improvement of the module and this document.
Thank you so much for the patient reading! I am available for any chat.
