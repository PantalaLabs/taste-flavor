Pantala Labs - Taste & Flavor / CMP<br>

Taste & Flavor is an Open-Source Eurorack module project of a step/gate sequencer coupled to a 6 track sample player and a track mixer that aims to fill a major gap in live performances with modular synthesizers allowing you to create a new mood with every percussion change. <br>

This mood transition is part of a concept I created called Mood Oriented Instruments. These instruments, in our case the module, must have the ability not only to reproduce sounds on demand, presets, but also, through algorithms, to add some level of intelligence to the final sound composition.<br>

The module has an easy to understand interface with few buttons / controls ensuring its easy use, creative and especially with extremely fluid dynamics for sound transitions inspired by the possibilities available in a DJ Set. Why the DJ Set? Because the DJ Set allows infinite flexibility in choosing the next song.<br>

The module operates with 6 sample tracks triggered by a predefined pattern. <br>

Allows samples and patterns from each individual track to be exchanged for samples and patterns from other MOODs.<br>

Allows you to edit each pattern using the Tap on each track.<br>

Allows you to Undo the Tap sequence if you miss some step.<br>
And finally, Morph's manual command that transitions track by track from one Mood to another. This is the biggest feature that guarantees the idea of "fluid dynamics."<br>
The project IS 100% DONE AND WAITING FOR THE FINAL PANELS.<br>
Why am I contacting you?<br>
I initially I´m asking a few Collaborative Music Producers (CMP) to share your MOOD samples with this incredible open-source project.<br>
If you received this project document, I somehow like your sound and, above that, I think it will be extremely useful in the hands of countless users of modular synthesizers.<br>
CMP collaboration works with  one (or more) sample kits that characterize your sound. That defines a part of the essence of your musical style, your idea of music.<br>
This Sample Kit associated with a Grid Pattern and a Fantasy Name mold a MOOD:
1. -6 samples: Can be any sound, kick, hats, snares, pads, ambients. All must be recorded with: 24bit / 44100kh and must have the final volume already processed. In the case of Kick and Bass, if played at the same time, they should be sent already mixed.<br>
2. -a grid pattern or a MIDI file: a 64 step grid organized in 4ppqn / 4 steps by Beat. It could even be a picture of Ableton or another DAW with the firing sequence of the samples. See Annex I<br>
3. -a fantasy name: A fancy name for your mood: Gibran Solomao-Walking on the Moon.<br>
The second point, is that, if you receive this briefing, I really like your music my exchange proposal does not involve money. PMC is a contributor.<br>
All project is Open-Source , so anyone can capy / share / modify the its contents. No money will be paid for the samples.<br>
If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them. Any questions will serve as material for the improvement of the module and this document.<br>
Thank you so much for the patient reading! I am available for any chat.<br>
